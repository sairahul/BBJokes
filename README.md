This is a demo app that shows how we can use [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org) in [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/). It shows how can use speech to text and speech synthesis apis. It also shows how we can use ajax feature(core-ajax). We make a query to [[http://www.icndb.com/api/]] and get a random Chuck Norris joke and show in the app !. 

We used following apis for speech to text and speech synthesis. 

```
cordova plugin add https://github.com/poiuytrez/SpeechRecognizer
cordova plugin add https://github.com/macdonst/SpeechSynthesisPlugin.git
```
